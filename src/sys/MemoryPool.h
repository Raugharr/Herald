/**
 * TODO: We should assign a memory pool to all the important and frequently used objects such as:
 * Person, Family, Crop, Good, and Population. These objects should be placed in as many pages as required,
 * however objects that are close to another such as a Good that is owned by a Family will be expected to be
 * used when the other object is used and thus they should be placed in the same page. If something happens that
 * breaks this rule like a Person who is in a completely filled page buys a Good, a grouping of objects should
 * be placed into another page.
